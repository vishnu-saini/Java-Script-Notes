# Promise

A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.

Essentially, a promise is a returned object to which you attach callbacks, instead of passing callbacks into a function.

Imagine a function, createAudioFileAsync(), which asynchronously generates a sound file given a configuration record and two callback functions, one called if the audio file is successfully created, and the other called if an error occurs.

Here's some code that uses createAudioFileAsync():
```javascript
function successCallback(result) {
  console.log("Audio file ready at URL: " + result);
}

function failureCallback(error) {
  console.log("Error generating audio file: " + error);
}

createAudioFileAsync(audioSettings, successCallback, failureCallback);
```
â€¦modern functions return a promise you can attach your callbacks to instead:

If createAudioFileAsync() were rewritten to return a promise, using it could be as simple as this:
```javascript
createAudioFileAsync(audioSettings).then(successCallback, failureCallback);
```
That's shorthand for:
```javascript
const promise = createAudioFileAsync(audioSettings); 
promise.then(successCallback, failureCallback);
```
We call this an asynchronous function call. This convention has several advantages. We will explore each one.

## Guarantees

Unlike old-style passed-in callbacks, a promise comes with some guarantees:

- Callbacks will never be called before the completion of the current run of the JavaScript event loop.
- Callbacks added with then() even after the success or failure of the asynchronous operation, will be called, as above.
- Multiple callbacks may be added by calling then() several times. Each callback is executed one after another, in the order in which they were inserted.


## Chaining
A common need is to execute two or more asynchronous operations back to back, where each subsequent operation starts when the previous operation succeeds, with the result from the previous step. We accomplish this by creating a promise chain.

Here's the magic: the then() function returns a new promise, different from the original:
```javascript
const promise = doSomething();
const promise2 = promise.then(successCallback, failureCallback);
```
This second promise represents the completion not just of doSomething(), but also of the successCallback or failureCallback you passed in, which can be other asynchronous functions returning a promise. When that's the case, any callbacks added to promise2 get queued behind the promise returned by either successCallback or failureCallback.

In the old days, doing several asynchronous operations in a row would lead to the classic callback pyramid of doom:
Here's the magic: the then() function returns a new promise, different from the original:
```javascript
doSomething(function(result) {
  doSomethingElse(result, function(newResult) {
    doThirdThing(newResult, function(finalResult) {
      console.log('Got the final result: ' + finalResult);
    }, failureCallback);
  }, failureCallback);
}, failureCallback);
```

With modern functions, we attach our callbacks to the returned promises instead, forming a promise chain:
```javascript
doSomething().then(function(result) {
  return doSomethingElse(result);
})
.then(function(newResult) {
  return doThirdThing(newResult);
})
.then(function(finalResult) {
  console.log('Got the final result: ' + finalResult);
})
.catch(failureCallback);

```
The arguments to then are optional, and catch(failureCallback) is short for then(null, failureCallback). You might see this expressed with arrow functions instead:

using arrow function: 
```javascript
doSomething()
.then(result => doSomethingElse(result))
.then(newResult => doThirdThing(newResult))
.then(finalResult => {
  console.log(`Got the final result: ${finalResult}`);
})
.catch(failureCallback);
```
## Chaining after a catch
It's possible to chain after a failure, i.e. a catch, which is useful to accomplish new actions even after an action failed in the chain. 
```javascript
new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    console.log('Initial');

    resolve();
})
.then(() => {
    throw new Error('Something failed');
        
    console.log('Do this');
})
.catch(() => {
    console.log('Do that');
})
.then(() => {
    console.log('Do this, no matter what happened before');
});
```

## Error propagation

You might recall seeing failureCallback three times in the pyramid of doom earlier, compared to only once at the end of the promise chain:
```javascript

doSomething()
.then(result => doSomethingElse(result))
.then(newResult => doThirdThing(newResult))
.then(finalResult => console.log(`Got the final result: ${finalResult}`))
.catch(failureCallback);
```
Basically, a promise chain stops if there's an exception, looking down the chain for catch handlers instead. This is very much modeled after how synchronous code works:

```javascript
try {
  const result = syncDoSomething();
  const newResult = syncDoSomethingElse(result);
  const finalResult = syncDoThirdThing(newResult);
  console.log(`Got the final result: ${finalResult}`);
} catch(error) {
  failureCallback(error);
}
```
This symmetry with synchronous code culminates in the async/await syntactic sugar in ECMAScript 2017:
```javascript
async function foo() {
  try {
    const result = await doSomething();
    const newResult = await doSomethingElse(result);
    const finalResult = await doThirdThing(newResult);
    console.log(`Got the final result: ${finalResult}`);
  } catch(error) {
    failureCallback(error);
  }
}
```
It builds on promises, e.g. doSomething() is the same function as before.

> Promises solve a fundamental flaw with the callback pyramid of doom, by catching all errors, even thrown exceptions and programming errors. This is essential for functional composition of asynchronous operations.

## Creating a Promise around an old callback API

A Promise can be created from scratch using its constructor. This should be needed only to wrap old APIs.

In an ideal world, all asynchronous functions would already return promises. Alas, some APIs still expect success and/or failure callbacks to be passed in the old way. The quintessential example is the setTimeout() function:

```javascript
setTimeout(() => saySomething("10 seconds passed"), 10000);
```
Mixing old-style callbacks and promises is problematic. If saySomething() fails or contains a programming error, nothing catches it.

Luckily we can wrap it in a promise. Best practice is to wrap problematic functions at the lowest possible level, and then never call them directly again:

```javascript
const wait = ms => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms));

wait(10000).then(() => saySomething("10 seconds")).catch(failureCallback);
```
Basically, the promise constructor takes an executor function that lets us resolve or reject a promise manually. Since setTimeout() doesn't really fail, we left out reject in this case.

## Composition
Promise.resolve() and Promise.reject() are shortcuts to manually create an already resolved or rejected promise respectively.

## Timing
To avoid surprises, functions passed to then() will never be called synchronously, even with an already-resolved promise:
```javascript
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log(2));
console.log(1); // 1, 2
```

Instead of running immediately, the passed-in function is put on a microtask queue, which means it runs later when the queue is emptied at the end of the current run of the JavaScript event loop, i.e. pretty soon:
```javascript
const wait = ms => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms));

wait().then(() => console.log(4));
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log(2)).then(() => console.log(3));
console.log(1); // 1, 2, 3, 4
```
