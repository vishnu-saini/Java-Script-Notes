# Promise

A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.

Essentially, a promise is a returned object to which you attach callbacks, instead of passing callbacks into a function.

Imagine a function, createAudioFileAsync(), which asynchronously generates a sound file given a configuration record and two callback functions, one called if the audio file is successfully created, and the other called if an error occurs.

Here's some code that uses createAudioFileAsync():
```javascript
function successCallback(result) {
  console.log("Audio file ready at URL: " + result);
}

function failureCallback(error) {
  console.log("Error generating audio file: " + error);
}

createAudioFileAsync(audioSettings, successCallback, failureCallback);
```
â€¦modern functions return a promise you can attach your callbacks to instead:

If createAudioFileAsync() were rewritten to return a promise, using it could be as simple as this:
```javascript
createAudioFileAsync(audioSettings).then(successCallback, failureCallback);
```
That's shorthand for:
```javascript
const promise = createAudioFileAsync(audioSettings); 
promise.then(successCallback, failureCallback);
```
We call this an asynchronous function call. This convention has several advantages. We will explore each one.

## Guarantees

Unlike old-style passed-in callbacks, a promise comes with some guarantees:

- Callbacks will never be called before the completion of the current run of the JavaScript event loop.
- Callbacks added with then() even after the success or failure of the asynchronous operation, will be called, as above.
- Multiple callbacks may be added by calling then() several times. Each callback is executed one after another, in the order in which they were inserted.
