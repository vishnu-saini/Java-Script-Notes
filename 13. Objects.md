# Working with objects

JavaScript is designed on a simple object-based paradigm. An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value. A property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method. In addition to objects that are predefined in the browser, you can define your own objects.

## Objects and properties
A JavaScript object has properties associated with it. A property of an object can be explained as a variable that is attached to the object

- You access the properties of an object with a simple dot-notation:
- Like all JavaScript variables, both the object name (which could be a normal variable) and property name are case sensitive.
- Properties of JavaScript objects can also be accessed or set using a bracket notation
- Objects are sometimes called associative arrays, since each property is associated with a string value that can be used to access it
- An object property name can be any valid JavaScript string, or anything that can be converted to a string, including the empty string.

```javascript
// four variables are created and assigned in a single go, 
// separated by commas
var myObj = new Object(),
    str = 'myString',
    rand = Math.random(),
    obj = new Object();

myObj.type              = 'Dot syntax';
myObj['date created']   = 'String with space';
myObj[str]              = 'String value';
myObj[rand]             = 'Random Number';
myObj[obj]              = 'Object';
myObj['']               = 'Even an empty string';

console.log(myObj);
```
You can also access properties by using a string value that is stored in a variable:
```javascript
var propertyName = 'make';
myCar[propertyName] = 'Ford';

propertyName = 'model';
myCar[propertyName] = 'Mustang';
```

## Enumerate the properties of an object
Starting with ECMAScript 5, there are three native ways to list/traverse object properties:

- `for...in loops` : This method traverses all enumerable properties of an object and its prototype chain
- `Object.keys(o)` : This method returns an array with all the own (not in the prototype chain) enumerable properties' names ("keys") of an object o.
- `Object.getOwnPropertyNames(o)` : This method returns an array containing all own properties' names (enumerable or not) of an object o.
Before ECMAScript 5, there was no native way to list all properties of an object. However, this can be achieved with the following function:

## Creating new objects

JavaScript has a number of predefined objects. In addition, you can create your own objects. You can create an object using an object initializer. Alternatively, you can first create a constructor function and then instantiate an object invoking that function in conjunction with the new operator.

### Using object initializers
```javascript
var obj = { property_1:   value_1,   // property_# may be an identifier...
            2:            value_2,   // or a number...
            // ...,
            'property n': value_n }; // or a string
```
Object initializers are expressions, and each object initializer results in a new object being created whenever the statement in which it appears is executed. Identical object initializers create distinct objects that will not compare to each other as equal.

## Using a constructor function
 you can create an object with these two steps:

- Define the object type by writing a constructor function. There is a strong convention, with good reason, to use a capital initial letter.
- Create an instance of the object with new.

```javascript
function Car(make, model, year) {
  this.make = make;
  this.model = model;
  this.year = year;
}
var mycar = new Car('Eagle', 'Talon TSi', 1993);
```
## Using the Object.create method
Objects can also be created using the Object.create() method. This method can be very useful, because it allows you to choose the prototype object for the object you want to create, without having to define a constructor function.

```javascript
// Animal properties and method encapsulation
var Animal = {
  type: 'Invertebrates', // Default value of properties
  displayType: function() {  // Method which will display type of Animal
    console.log(this.type);
  }
};

// Create new animal type called animal1 
var animal1 = Object.create(Animal);
animal1.displayType(); // Output:Invertebrates

// Create new animal type called Fishes
var fish = Object.create(Animal);
fish.type = 'Fishes';
fish.displayType(); // Output:Fishes
```

## Inheritance
All objects in JavaScript inherit from at least one other object. The object being inherited from is known as the prototype, and the inherited properties can be found in the prototype object of the constructor.

## Indexing object properties
You can refer to a property of an object either by its property name or by its ordinal index. If you initially define a property by its name, you must always refer to it by its name, and if you initially define a property by an index, you must always refer to it by its index.
 If you initially define an object property with an index, such as myCar[5] = "25 mpg", you subsequently refer to the property only as myCar[5].
 
 The exception to this rule is array-like object reflected from HTML, such as the forms array-like object. You can always refer to objects in these array-like objects by either their ordinal number (based on where they appear in the document) or their name (if defined). 
 
 ## Defining properties for an object type
 You can add a property to a previously defined object type by using the prototype property. This defines a property that is shared by all objects of the specified type, rather than by just one instance of the object. The following code adds a color property to all objects of type Car, and then assigns a value to the color property of the object car1.
```javascript
Car.prototype.color = null;
car1.color = 'black';
```

## Defining getters and setters
A getter is a method that gets the value of a specific property. A setter is a method that sets the value of a specific property. You can define getters and setters on any predefined core object or user-defined object that supports the addition of new properties. The syntax for defining getters and setters uses the object literal syntax.

The following illustrates how getters and setters could work for a user-defined object o.
```javascript
var o = {
  a: 7,
  get b() { 
    return this.a + 1;
  },
  set c(x) {
    this.a = x / 2;
  }
};

console.log(o.a); // 7
console.log(o.b); // 8
o.c = 50;
console.log(o.a); // 25
```

Please note that function names of getters and setters defined in an object literal using "[gs]et property()" (as opposed to __define[GS]etter__ ) are not the names of the getters themselves, even though the [gs]et propertyName(){ } syntax may mislead you to think otherwise. To name a function in a getter or setter using the "[gs]et property()" syntax, define an explicitly named function programmatically using Object.defineProperty (or the Object.prototype.__defineGetter__ legacy fallback).

The following code illustrates how getters and setters can extend the Date prototype to add a year property to all instances of the predefined Date class. It uses the Date class's existing getFullYear and setFullYear methods to support the year property's getter and setter.

These statements define a getter and setter for the year property:
```javascript
var d = Date.prototype;
Object.defineProperty(d, 'year', {
  get: function() { return this.getFullYear(); },
  set: function(y) { this.setFullYear(y); }
});
var now = new Date();
console.log(now.year); // 2000
now.year = 2001; // 987617605170
console.log(now);
// Wed Apr 18 11:13:25 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time) 2001
 ```
 
 In principle, getters and setters can be either

- defined using object initializers, or
- added later to any object at any time using a getter or setter adding method.

## Deleting properties
You can remove a non-inherited property by using the delete operator. The following code shows how to remove a property.
```javascript
// Creates a new object, myobj, with two properties, a and b.
var myobj = new Object;
myobj.a = 5;
myobj.b = 12;

// Removes the a property, leaving myobj with only the b property.
delete myobj.a;
console.log ('a' in myobj); // yields "false"
```
You can also use delete to delete a global variable if the var keyword was not used to declare the variable:
```javascript
g = 17;
delete g;
```

## Comparing Objects

In JavaScript objects are a reference type. Two distinct objects are never equal, even if they have the same properties. Only comparing the same object reference with itself yields true.
```javascript
// Two variables, two distinct objects with the same properties
var fruit = {name: 'apple'};
var fruitbear = {name: 'apple'};

fruit == fruitbear; // return false
fruit === fruitbear; // return false
// Two variables, a single object
var fruit = {name: 'apple'};
var fruitbear = fruit;  // assign fruit object reference to fruitbear

// here fruit and fruitbear are pointing to same object
fruit == fruitbear; // return true
fruit === fruitbear; // return true
fruit.name = 'grape';
console.log(fruitbear);    // yields { name: "grape" } instead of { name: "apple" }
```
