# Function

Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function is a JavaScript procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.

- Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in the calling function.
- If you pass an object (i.e. a non-primitive value, such as Array or a user-defined object) as a parameter and the function changes the object's properties, that change is visible outside the function, as shown in the following example:
```javascript
function myFunc(theObject) {
  theObject.make = 'Toyota';
}

var mycar = {make: 'Honda', model: 'Accord', year: 1998};
var x, y;

x = mycar.make; // x gets the value "Honda"

myFunc(mycar);
y = mycar.make; // y gets the value "Toyota"
                // (the make property was changed by the function)
```

## Function expressions

While the function declaration above is syntactically a statement, functions can also be created by a function expression. Such a function can be anonymous; it does not have to have a name. For example, the function square could have been defined as:
```javascript
var square = function(number) { return number * number; };
var x = square(4); // x gets the value 16
```

However, a name can be provided with a function expression and can be used inside the function to refer to itself, or in a debugger to identify the function in stack traces:

> Function expressions are convenient when passing a function as an argument to another function

>In addition to defining functions as described here, you can also use the Function constructor to create functions from a string at runtime, much like eval().

## Calling functions

Functions must be in scope when they are called, but the function declaration can be hoisted. This works only when defining the function using the above syntax (i.e. function funcName(){}). The code below will not work. That means, function hoisting only works with function declaration and not with function expression.
```javascript
console.log(square); // square is hoisted with an initial value undefined.
console.log(square(5)); // TypeError: square is not a function
var square = function(n) { 
  return n * n; 
}
```
#### bind, call and apply

- The **`bind()`** method creates a new function that, when called, has its this keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of 
    arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called. Function.prototype.bind()
    ```
    var module = {
      x: 42,
      getX: function() {
        return this.x;
      }
    }

    var unboundGetX = module.getX;
    console.log(unboundGetX()); // The function gets invoked at the global scope
    // expected output: undefined

    var boundGetX = unboundGetX.bind(module);
    console.log(boundGetX());
    // expected output: 42
    ```    
- The **`call()`** method calls a function with a given this value and arguments provided individually.
    ```
    function Product(name, price) {
      this.name = name;
      this.price = price;
    }

    function Food(name, price) {
      Product.call(this, name, price);
      this.category = 'food';
    }

    console.log(new Food('cheese', 5).name);
    // expected output: "cheese"
    ```
- The **`apply()`** method calls a function with a given this value, and arguments provided as an array (or an array-like object).
    ```
    var numbers = [5, 6, 2, 3, 7];

    var max = Math.max.apply(null, numbers);

    console.log(max);
    // expected output: 7

    var min = Math.min.apply(null, numbers);

    console.log(min);
    // expected output: 2
    ```    
Note: While the syntax of this function is almost identical to that of call(), the fundamental difference is that call() accepts an argument list, while apply() accepts a single array of arguments.


## Function scope
Variables defined inside a function cannot be accessed from anywhere outside the function, because the variable is defined only in the scope of the function. However, a function can access all variables and functions defined inside the scope in which it is defined.

### Recursion

A function can refer to and call itself. There are three ways for a function to refer to itself:

- the function's name
- arguments.callee
- an in-scope variable that refers to the function
```javascript
var foo = function bar() {
   // statements go here
};
```
Within the function body, the following are all equivalent:

1. bar()
2. arguments.callee()
3. foo()

It is possible to convert any recursive algorithm to a non-recursive one, but often the logic is much more complex and doing so requires the use of a stack. In fact, recursion itself uses a stack: the function stack.

## Nested functions and closures

You can nest a function within a function. The nested (inner) function is private to its containing (outer) function. It also forms a closure. A closure is an expression (typically a function) that can have free variables together with an environment that binds those variables (that "closes" the expression).

Since a nested function is a closure, this means that a nested function can "inherit" the arguments and variables of its containing function. In other words, the inner function contains the scope of the outer function.

```javascript
function outside(x) {
  function inside(y) {
    return x + y;
  }
  return inside;
}
fn_inside = outside(3); // Think of it like: give me a function that adds 3 to whatever you give
                        // it
result = fn_inside(5); // returns 8

result1 = outside(3)(5); // returns 8
```

> Since each call provides potentially different arguments, a new closure is created for each call to outside. The memory can be freed only when the returned inside is no longer accessible.

>When two arguments or variables in the scopes of a closure have the same name, there is a name conflict. More inner scopes take precedence, so the inner-most scope takes the highest precedence, while the outer-most scope takes the lowest.

# Closures

Closures are one of the most powerful features of JavaScript. JavaScript allows for the nesting of functions and grants the inner function full access to all the variables and functions defined inside the outer function (and all other variables and functions that the outer function has access to). However, the outer function does not have access to the variables and functions defined inside the inner function. This provides a sort of encapsulation for the variables of the inner function. Also, since the inner function has access to the scope of the outer function, the variables and functions defined in the outer function will live longer than the duration of the inner function execution, if the inner function manages to survive beyond the life of the outer function. A closure is created when the inner function is somehow made available to any scope outside the outer function.

It can be much more complex than the code above. An object containing methods for manipulating the inner variables of the outer function can be returned.

```javascript

var createPet = function(name) {
  var sex;
  
  return {
    setName: function(newName) {
      name = newName;
    },
    
    getName: function() {
      return name;
    },
    
    getSex: function() {
      return sex;
    },
    
    setSex: function(newSex) {
      if(typeof newSex === 'string' && (newSex.toLowerCase() === 'male' || 
        newSex.toLowerCase() === 'female')) {
        sex = newSex;
      }
    }
  }
}

var pet = createPet('Vivie');
pet.getName();                  // Vivie

pet.setName('Oliver');
pet.setSex('male');
pet.getSex();                   // male
pet.getName();                  // Oliver
```

There are, however, a number of pitfalls to watch out for when using closures. If an enclosed function defines a variable with the same name as the name of a variable in the outer scope, there is no way to refer to the variable in the outer scope again.

```javascript
var createPet = function(name) {  // The outer function defines a variable called "name".
  return {
    setName: function(name) {    // The enclosed function also defines a variable called "name".
      name = name;               // How do we access the "name" defined by the outer function?
    }
  }
}
```
## arguments object

The arguments of a function are maintained in an array-like object. Within a function, you can address the arguments passed to it as follows:
```
arguments[i]
```
This is often useful if you don't know in advance how many arguments will be passed to the function. You can use arguments.length to determine the number of arguments actually passed to the function, and then access each argument using the arguments object

> **Note:** The arguments variable is "array-like", but not an array. It is array-like in that it has a numbered index and a length property. However, it does not possess all of the array-manipulation methods.

## Function parameters
Starting with ECMAScript 2015, there are two new kinds of parameters: default parameters and rest parameters.
### Default parameters
In JavaScript, parameters of functions default to undefined. However, in some situations it might be useful to set a different default value. This is where default parameters can help.

In the past, the general strategy for setting defaults was to test parameter values in the body of the function and assign a value if they are undefined.

```javascript
function multiply(a, b) {
  b = typeof b !== 'undefined' ?  b : 1;

  return a * b;
}

multiply(5); // 5
```
With default parameters, the check in the function body is no longer necessary. Now, you can simply put 1 as the default value for b in the function head:
```javascript
function multiply(a, b = 1) {
  return a * b;
}

multiply(5); // 5
```

### Rest parameters
The rest parameter syntax allows us to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array.
```
function multiply(multiplier, ...theArgs) {
  return theArgs.map(x => multiplier * x);
}
```
## Arrow functions
An arrow function expression (previously, and now incorrectly known as fat arrow function) has a shorter syntax compared to function expressions and does not have its own this, arguments, super, or new.target. Arrow functions are always anonymous. 

Two factors influenced the introduction of arrow functions: shorter functions and non-binding of this.

### Shorter functions
```javascript
var a = [
  'Hydrogen',
  'Helium',
  'Lithium',
  'Beryllium'
];

var a2 = a.map(function(s) { return s.length; });

console.log(a2); // logs [8, 6, 7, 9]

var a3 = a.map(s => s.length);

console.log(a3); // logs [8, 6, 7, 9]
```
### No separate this
Until arrow functions, every new function defined its own this value (a new object in the case of a constructor, undefined in strict mode function calls, the base object if the function is called as an "object method", etc.). This proved to be less than ideal with an object-oriented style of programming.

```javascript
function Person() {
  // The Person() constructor defines `this` as itself.
  this.age = 0;

  setInterval(function growUp() {
    // In nonstrict mode, the growUp() function defines `this` 
    // as the global object, which is different from the `this`
    // defined by the Person() constructor.
    this.age++;
  }, 1000);
}

var p = new Person();
```
  In ECMAScript 3/5, this issue was fixed by assigning the value in this to a variable that could be closed over.
  
> An arrow function does not have its own this; the this value of the enclosing execution context is used. Thus, in the following code, the this within the function that is passed to setInterval has the same value as this in the enclosing function:
```javascript
function Person() {
  this.age = 0;

  setInterval(() => {
    this.age++; // |this| properly refers to the person object
  }, 1000);
}

var p = new Person();
```

# Predefined functions
JavaScript has several top-level, built-in functions:

- **`eval()`**

The eval() method evaluates JavaScript code represented as a string.

- **`uneval()`** 

The uneval() method creates a string representation of the source code of an Object.

- **`isFinite()`**

The global isFinite() function determines whether the passed value is a finite number. If needed, the parameter is first converted to a number.

- **`isNaN()`**

The isNaN() function determines whether a value is NaN or not. Note: coercion inside the isNaN function has interesting rules; you may alternatively want to use Number.isNaN(), as defined in ECMAScript 2015, or you can use typeof to determine if the value is Not-A-Number.

- **`parseFloat()`**

The parseFloat() function parses a string argument and returns a floating point number.

- **`parseInt()`**

The parseInt() function parses a string argument and returns an integer of the specified radix (the base in mathematical numeral systems).

- **`decodeURI()`**

The decodeURI() function decodes a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) previously created by encodeURI or by a similar routine.

- **`decodeURIComponent()`**

The decodeURIComponent() method decodes a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) component previously created by encodeURIComponent or by a similar routine.

- **`encodeURI()`**

The encodeURI() method encodes a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) by replacing each instance of certain characters by one, two, three, or four escape sequences representing the UTF-8 encoding of the character (will only be four escape sequences for characters composed of two "surrogate" characters).

- **`encodeURIComponent()`**

The encodeURIComponent() method encodes a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) component by replacing each instance of certain characters by one, two, three, or four escape sequences representing the UTF-8 encoding of the character (will only be four escape sequences for characters composed of two "surrogate" characters).

- **`escape()`**

The deprecated escape() method computes a new string in which certain characters have been replaced by a hexadecimal escape sequence. Use encodeURI or encodeURIComponent instead.

- **`unescape()`**

The deprecated unescape() method computes a new string in which hexadecimal escape sequences are replaced with the character that it represents. The escape sequences might be introduced by a function like escape. Because unescape() is deprecated, use decodeURI() or decodeURIComponent instead.
