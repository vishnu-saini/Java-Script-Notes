# Iterators and Generators

Processing each of the items in a collection is a very common operation. JavaScript provides a number of ways of iterating over a collection, from simple for loops to map() and filter(). Iterators and Generators bring the concept of iteration directly into the core language and provide a mechanism for customizing the behavior of for...of loops.

# Iterators
In JavaScript an iterator is an object which defines a sequence and potentially a return value upon its termination. More specifically an iterator is any object which implements the Iterator protocol by having a next() method which returns an object with two properties: value, the next value in the sequence; and done, which is true if the last value in the sequence has already been consumed. If value is present alongside done, it is the iterator's return value.

The most common iterator in Javascript is the Array iterator, which simply returns each value in the associated array in sequence.

A simple iterator which runs between a given range 

```javascript 
function makeRangeIterator(start = 0, end = Infinity, step = 1) {
    var nextIndex = start;
    var n = 0;

    var rangeIterator = {
       next: function() {
           var result;
           if (nextIndex < end) {
               result = { value: nextIndex, done: false }
           } else if (nextIndex == end) {
               result = { value: n, done: true }
           } else {
               result = { done: true }
           }
           nextIndex += step;
           n++;
           return result;
       }
    };
    return rangeIterator;
}


var it = makeRangeIterator(1, 4);

var result = it.next();
while (!result.done) {
 console.log(result.value); // 1 2 3
 result = it.next();
}

console.log("Iterated over sequence of size: ", result.value);
```

# Generator functions
While custom iterators are a useful tool, their creation requires careful programming due to the need to explicitly maintain their internal state. Generator functions provide a powerful alternative: they allow you to define an iterative algorithm by writing a single function whose execution is not continuous. Generator functions are written using the function* syntax. When called initially, generator functions do not execute any of their code, instead returning a type of iterator called a Generator. When a value is consumed by calling the generator's next method, the Generator function executes until it encounters the yield keyword.

The function can be called as many times as desired and returns a new Generator each time, however each Generator may only be iterated once.

```javascript
function* makeRangeIterator(start = 0, end = Infinity, step = 1) {
    let n = 0;
    for (let i = start; i < end; i += step) {
        n++;
        yield i;
    }
    return n;
}
```


# Iterables

An object is iterable if it defines its iteration behavior, such as what values are looped over in a `for...of` construct. Some built-in types, such as Array or Map, have a default iteration behavior, while other types (such as Object) do not.

In order to be iterable, an object must implement the `@@iterator` method, meaning that the object (or one of the objects up its prototype chain) must have a property with a `Symbol.iterator` key.

It may be possible to iterate over an iterable more than once, or only once. It is up to the programmer to know which is the case. Iterables which can iterate only once (e.g. Generators) customarily return `this` from their `@@iterator` method, where those which can be iterated many times must return a new iterator on each invocation of `@@iterator`.

## User-defined iterables
We can make our own iterables like this:
```javascript
var myIterable = {
    *[Symbol.iterator]() {
        yield 1;
        yield 2;
        yield 3;
    }
}

for (let value of myIterable) { 
    console.log(value); 
}
// 1
// 2
// 3

or

[...myIterable]; // [1, 2, 3]
```

## Built-in iterables
String, Array, TypedArray, Map and Set are all built-in iterables, because their prototype objects all have a Symbol.iterator method.

## Syntaxes expecting iterables
Some statements and expressions are expecting iterables, for example the for-of loops, spread syntax, yield*, and destructuring assignment.

```javascript
for (let value of ['a', 'b', 'c']) {
    console.log(value);
}
// "a"
// "b"
// "c"

[...'abc']; // ["a", "b", "c"]

function* gen() {
  yield* ['a', 'b', 'c'];
}

gen().next(); // { value: "a", done: false }

[a, b, c] = new Set(['a', 'b', 'c']);
a; // "a"
```

# Advanced generators

Generators compute their yielded values on demand, which allows them to efficiently represent sequences that are expensive to compute, or even infinite sequences as demonstrated above.

The `next()` method also accepts a value which can be used to modify the internal state of the generator. A value passed to `next()` will be treated as the result of the last `yield` expression that paused the generator.

Here is the fibonacci generator using `next(x)` to restart the sequence:
```javascript
function* fibonacci() {
  var fn1 = 0;
  var fn2 = 1;
  while (true) {  
    var current = fn1;
    fn1 = fn2;
    fn2 = current + fn1;
    var reset = yield current;
    if (reset) {
        fn1 = 0;
        fn2 = 1;
    }
  }
}

var sequence = fibonacci();
console.log(sequence.next().value);     // 0
console.log(sequence.next().value);     // 1
console.log(sequence.next().value);     // 1
console.log(sequence.next().value);     // 2
console.log(sequence.next().value);     // 3
console.log(sequence.next().value);     // 5
console.log(sequence.next().value);     // 8
console.log(sequence.next(true).value); // 0
console.log(sequence.next().value);     // 1
console.log(sequence.next().value);     // 1
console.log(sequence.next().value);     // 2
```
You can force a generator to throw an exception by calling its `throw()` method and passing the exception value it should throw. This exception will be thrown from the current suspended context of the generator, as if the `yield` that is currently suspended were instead a `throw value` statement.

If the exception is not caught from within the generator,  it will propagate up through the call to `throw()`, and subsequent calls to `next()` will result in the `done` property being `true`.

Generators have a `return(value)` method that returns the given value and finishes the generator itself.
