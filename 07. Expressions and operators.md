# Operators
JavaScript has the following types of operators. This section describes the operators and contains information about operator precedence.

- Assignment operators
- Comparison operators
- Arithmetic operators
- Bitwise operators
- Logical operators
- String operators
- Conditional (ternary) operator
- Comma operator
- Unary operators
- Relational operators

## Assignment operators
An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The simple assignment operator is equal (=), which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. That is, x = y assigns the value of y to x.

### Destructuring
For more complex assignments, the destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to extract data from arrays or objects using a syntax that mirrors the construction of array and object literals.
```javascript
var foo = ['one', 'two', 'three'];

// without destructuring
var one   = foo[0];
var two   = foo[1];
var three = foo[2];

// with destructuring
var [one, two, three] = foo;
```

## Comparison operators

A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true. The operands can be numerical, string, logical, or object values. Strings are compared based on standard lexicographical ordering, using Unicode values. In most cases, if the two operands are not of the same type, JavaScript attempts to convert them to an appropriate type for the comparison. This behavior generally results in comparing the operands numerically. The sole exceptions to type conversion within comparisons involve the === and !== operators, which perform strict equality and inequality comparisons. These operators do not attempt to convert the operands to compatible types before checking equality. The following table describes the comparison operators in terms of this sample code:

> **NOTE:** `(=>)` is not an operator, but the notation for Arrow functions.

## Arithmetic operators
An arithmetic operator takes numerical values (either literals or variables) as their operands and returns a single numerical value.

Operator | 	Description | 	Example
--- | --- | ---
Unary negation (-) | 	Unary operator. Returns the negation of its operand.	 | If x is 3, then -x returns -3.
Unary plus (+) | 	Unary operator. Attempts to convert the operand to a number, |  if it is not already.	+"3" returns 3.
+true returns 1.
Exponentiation operator (**) |  	Calculates the base to the exponent power, that is, baseexponent | 	2 ** 3 returns 8. 10 ** -1 returns 0.1.


## Bitwise operators
A bitwise operator treats their operands as a set of 32 bits (zeros and ones), rather than as decimal, hexadecimal, or octal numbers.

Operator | 	Usage Expression | 	Description
--- | --- | ---
Bitwise AND | 	`a & b` | 	Returns a one in each bit position for which the corresponding bits of both operands are ones.
Bitwise OR | 	`a \| b` | 	Returns a zero in each bit position for which the corresponding bits of both operands are zeros.
Bitwise XOR | 	`a ^ b` | 	Returns a zero in each bit position for which the corresponding bits are the same. [Returns a one in each bit position for which the corresponding bits are different.]
Bitwise NOT | 	`~ a `| 	Inverts the bits of its operand.
Left shift | 	`a << b` | 	Shifts a in binary representation b bits to the left, shifting in zeros from the right. `9<<2` yields 36, because 1001 shifted 2 bits to the left becomes 100100, which is 36.
Sign-propagating right shift | `a >> b` | 	Shifts a in binary representation b bits to the right, discarding bits shifted off. `9>>2` yields 2, because 1001 shifted 2 bits to the right becomes 10, which is 2. Likewise, `-9>>2` yields -3, because the sign is preserved.
Zero-fill right shift | 	`a >>> b`	 | Shifts a in binary representation b bits to the right, discarding bits shifted off, and shifting in zeros from the left. `19>>>2` yields 4, because 10011 shifted 2 bits to the right becomes 100, which is 4. For non-negative numbers, zero-fill right shift and sign-propagating right shift yield the same result.

### Bitwise logical operators
Conceptually, the bitwise logical operators work as follows:

The operands are converted to thirty-two-bit integers and expressed by a series of bits (zeros and ones). Numbers with more than 32 bits get their most significant bits discarded. For example, the following integer with more than 32 bits will be converted to a 32 bit integer:
```
Before: 11100110111110100000000000000110000000000001
After:              10100000000000000110000000000001
```

Each bit in the first operand is paired with the corresponding bit in the second operand: first bit to first bit, second bit to second bit, and so on.
The operator is applied to each pair of bits, and the result is constructed bitwise.

> JavaScript stores numbers as 64 bits floating point numbers, but all bitwise operations are performed on 32 bits binary numbers.

> After the bitwise operation is performed, the result is converted back to 64 bits JavaScript numbers.


**NOT (~)**

~x evaluates to the same value that -x - 1 evaluates to.

```
5 : 	00000000000000000000000000000101
~5 : 	11111111111111111111111111111010 (-6)
```

### two's complement format

JavaScript binary numbers are stored in two's complement format.

This means that a negative number is the bitwise NOT of the number plus 1:

Binary Representation | 	Decimal value
--- | ---
00000000000000000000000000000101 | 	5
11111111111111111111111111111011 | 	-5
00000000000000000000000000000110 | 	6
11111111111111111111111111111010 | 	-6
00000000000000000000000000101000 | 	40
11111111111111111111111111011000 | 	-40


## Logical operators

Logical operators are typically used with Boolean (logical) values; when they are, they return a Boolean value. However, the && and || operators actually return the value of one of the specified operands, so if these operators are used with non-Boolean values, they may return a non-Boolean value. The logical operators are described in the following table.

### Logical operators
Operator | 	Usage Expression | 	Description
--- | --- | ---
Logical AND (&&) | 	`expr1 && expr2` | 	Returns expr1 if it can be converted to false; otherwise, returns expr2. Thus, when used with Boolean values, && returns true if both operands are true; otherwise, returns false.
Logical OR (\|\|)	 | `expr1 \|\| expr2`	 | Returns expr1 if it can be converted to true; otherwise, returns expr2. Thus, when used with Boolean values, || returns true if either operand is true; if both are false, returns false.
Logical NOT (!) | 	`!expr` | 	Returns false if its single operand that can be converted to true; otherwise, returns true.

Examples of expressions that can be converted to false are those that evaluate to null, 0, NaN, the empty string (""), or undefined.

The following code shows examples of the && (logical AND) operator.
```javascript
var a1 =  true && true;     // t && t returns true
var a2 =  true && false;    // t && f returns false
var a3 = false && true;     // f && t returns false
var a4 = false && (3 == 4); // f && f returns false
var a5 = 'Cat' && 'Dog';    // t && t returns Dog
var a6 = false && 'Cat';    // f && t returns false
var a7 = 'Cat' && false;    // t && f returns false
```
The following code shows examples of the || (logical OR) operator.
```javascript
var o1 =  true || true;     // t || t returns true
var o2 = false || true;     // f || t returns true
var o3 =  true || false;    // t || f returns true
var o4 = false || (3 == 4); // f || f returns false
var o5 = 'Cat' || 'Dog';    // t || t returns Cat
var o6 = false || 'Cat';    // f || t returns Cat
var o7 = 'Cat' || false;    // t || f returns Cat
```
The following code shows examples of the ! (logical NOT) operator.
```javascript
var n1 = !true;  // !t returns false
var n2 = !false; // !f returns true
var n3 = !'Cat'; // !t returns false
```
###Short-circuit evaluation

As logical expressions are evaluated left to right, they are tested for possible "short-circuit" evaluation using the following rules:

- false && anything is short-circuit evaluated to false.
- true || anything is short-circuit evaluated to true.

The rules of logic guarantee that these evaluations are always correct. Note that the anything part of the above expressions is not evaluated, so any side effects of doing so do not take effect.
