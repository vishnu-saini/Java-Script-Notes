# Operators
JavaScript has the following types of operators. This section describes the operators and contains information about operator precedence.

- Assignment operators
- Comparison operators
- Arithmetic operators
- Bitwise operators
- Logical operators
- String operators
- Conditional (ternary) operator
- Comma operator
- Unary operators
- Relational operators

## Assignment operators
An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The simple assignment operator is equal (=), which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. That is, x = y assigns the value of y to x.

### Destructuring
For more complex assignments, the destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to extract data from arrays or objects using a syntax that mirrors the construction of array and object literals.
```javascript
var foo = ['one', 'two', 'three'];

// without destructuring
var one   = foo[0];
var two   = foo[1];
var three = foo[2];

// with destructuring
var [one, two, three] = foo;
```

## Comparison operators

A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true. The operands can be numerical, string, logical, or object values. Strings are compared based on standard lexicographical ordering, using Unicode values. In most cases, if the two operands are not of the same type, JavaScript attempts to convert them to an appropriate type for the comparison. This behavior generally results in comparing the operands numerically. The sole exceptions to type conversion within comparisons involve the === and !== operators, which perform strict equality and inequality comparisons. These operators do not attempt to convert the operands to compatible types before checking equality. The following table describes the comparison operators in terms of this sample code:

> **NOTE:** `(=>)` is not an operator, but the notation for Arrow functions.

## Arithmetic operators
An arithmetic operator takes numerical values (either literals or variables) as their operands and returns a single numerical value.

Operator | 	Description | 	Example
--- | --- | ---
Unary negation (-) | 	Unary operator. Returns the negation of its operand.	 | If x is 3, then -x returns -3.
Unary plus (+) | 	Unary operator. Attempts to convert the operand to a number, |  if it is not already.	+"3" returns 3.
+true returns 1.
Exponentiation operator (**) |  	Calculates the base to the exponent power, that is, baseexponent | 	2 ** 3 returns 8. 10 ** -1 returns 0.1.


## Bitwise operators
A bitwise operator treats their operands as a set of 32 bits (zeros and ones), rather than as decimal, hexadecimal, or octal numbers.

Operator | 	Usage Expression | 	Description
--- | --- | ---
Bitwise AND | 	`a & b` | 	Returns a one in each bit position for which the corresponding bits of both operands are ones.
Bitwise OR | 	`a \| b` | 	Returns a zero in each bit position for which the corresponding bits of both operands are zeros.
Bitwise XOR | 	`a ^ b` | 	Returns a zero in each bit position for which the corresponding bits are the same. [Returns a one in each bit position for which the corresponding bits are different.]
Bitwise NOT | 	`~ a `| 	Inverts the bits of its operand.
Left shift | 	`a << b` | 	Shifts a in binary representation b bits to the left, shifting in zeros from the right.
Sign-propagating right shift | `a >> b` | 	Shifts a in binary representation b bits to the right, discarding bits shifted off.
Zero-fill right shift | 	`a >>> b`	 | Shifts a in binary representation b bits to the right, discarding bits shifted off, and shifting in zeros from the left.

### Bitwise logical operators
Conceptually, the bitwise logical operators work as follows:

The operands are converted to thirty-two-bit integers and expressed by a series of bits (zeros and ones). Numbers with more than 32 bits get their most significant bits discarded. For example, the following integer with more than 32 bits will be converted to a 32 bit integer:
```
Before: 11100110111110100000000000000110000000000001
After:              10100000000000000110000000000001
```

Each bit in the first operand is paired with the corresponding bit in the second operand: first bit to first bit, second bit to second bit, and so on.
The operator is applied to each pair of bits, and the result is constructed bitwise.

> JavaScript stores numbers as 64 bits floating point numbers, but all bitwise operations are performed on 32 bits binary numbers.

> After the bitwise operation is performed, the result is converted back to 64 bits JavaScript numbers.


**NOT (~)**
~x evaluates to the same value that -x - 1 evaluates to.

> 5 : 	00000000000000000000000000000101
> ~5 : 	11111111111111111111111111111010 (-6)



## two's complement format

JavaScript binary numbers are stored in two's complement format.

This means that a negative number is the bitwise NOT of the number plus 1:

Binary Representation | 	Decimal value
--- | ---
00000000000000000000000000000101 | 	5
11111111111111111111111111111011 | 	-5
00000000000000000000000000000110 | 	6
11111111111111111111111111111010 | 	-6
00000000000000000000000000101000 | 	40



11111111111111111111111111011000 | 	-40
