# Maps

## Map object
ECMAScript 2015 introduces a new data structure to map values to values. A Map object is a simple key/value map and can iterate its elements in insertion order

You can use a for...of loop to return an array of [key, value] for each iteration.

```javascript
var sayings = new Map();
sayings.set('dog', 'woof');
sayings.set('cat', 'meow');
sayings.set('elephant', 'toot');
sayings.size; // 3
sayings.get('fox'); // undefined
sayings.has('bird'); // false
sayings.delete('dog');
sayings.has('dog'); // false

for (var [key, value] of sayings) {
  console.log(key + ' goes ' + value);
}
// "cat goes meow"
// "elephant goes toot"

sayings.clear();
sayings.size; // 0
```

## Object and Map compared
Traditionally, objects have been used to map strings to values. Objects allow you to set keys to values, retrieve those values, delete keys, and detect whether something is stored at a key. Map objects, however, have a few more advantages that make them better maps.

- The keys of an Object are Strings, where they can be of any value for a Map.
- You can get the size of a Map easily while you have to manually keep track of size for an Object.
- The iteration of maps is in insertion order of the elements.
- An Object has a prototype, so there are default keys in the map. (this can be bypassed using map = Object.create(null)).

These three tips can help you to decide whether to use a Map or an Object:

- Use maps over objects when keys are unknown until run time, and when all keys are the same type and all values are the same type.
- Use maps if there is a need to store primitive values as keys because object treats each key as a string whether it's a number value, boolean value or any other primitive value.
- Use objects when there is logic that operates on individual elements.

## WeakMap object
The `WeakMap` object is a collection of key/value pairs in which the keys are objects only and the values can be arbitrary values. The object references in the keys are held weakly, meaning that they are a target of garbage collection (GC) if there is no other reference to the object anymore. The `WeakMap` API is the same as the `Map` API.

One difference to `Map` objects is that `WeakMap` keys are not enumerable (i.e., there is no method giving you a list of the keys). If they were, the list would depend on the state of garbage collection, introducing non-determinism.


# Sets
## Set object
Set objects are collections of values. You can iterate its elements in insertion order. A value in a Set may only occur once; it is unique in the Set's collection.

The following code shows some basic operations with a Set. See also the Set reference page for more examples and the complete API.
```javascript
var mySet = new Set();
mySet.add(1);
mySet.add('some text');
mySet.add('foo');

mySet.has(1); // true
mySet.delete('foo');
mySet.size; // 2

for (let item of mySet) console.log(item);
// 1
// "some text"
```

## Converting between Array and Set
You can create an `Array` from a Set using `Array.from` or the spread operator. Also, the `Set` constructor accepts an `Array` to convert in the other direction. Note again that Set objects store unique values, so any duplicate elements from an Array are deleted when converting.
```javascript
Array.from(mySet);
[...mySet2];

mySet2 = new Set([1, 2, 3, 4]);
```
## Array and Set compared
Traditionally, a set of elements has been stored in arrays in JavaScript in a lot of situations. The new Set object, however, has some advantages:

- Checking whether an element exists in a collection using indexOf for arrays is slow.
- Set objects let you delete elements by their value. With an array you would have to splice based on an element's index.
- The value NaN cannot be found with indexOf in an array.
- Set objects store unique values; you don't have to keep track of duplicates by yourself.
## WeakSet object
WeakSet objects are collections of objects. An object in the WeakSet may only occur once; it is unique in the WeakSet's collection and objects are not enumerable.

The main differences to the Set object are:

- In contrast to Sets, WeakSets are collections of objects only and not of arbitrary values of any type.
- The WeakSet is weak: References to objects in the collection are held weakly. If there is no other reference to an object stored in the WeakSet, they can be garbage collected. That also means that there is no list of current objects stored in the collection. WeakSets are not enumerable.
The use cases of WeakSet objects are limited. They will not leak memory so it can be safe to use DOM elements as a key and mark them for tracking purposes, for example.
