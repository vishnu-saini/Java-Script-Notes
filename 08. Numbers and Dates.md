# Numbers

In JavaScript, all numbers are implemented in double-precision 64-bit binary format IEEE 754 (i.e. a number between -(2^53 -1) and 2^53 -1). There is no specific type for integers. In addition to being able to represent floating-point numbers, the number type has three symbolic values: `+Infinity`, `-Infinity`, and `NaN` (not-a-number).

## Decimal numbers
```
1234567890
42

// Caution when using leading zeros:

0888 // 888 parsed as decimal
0777 // parsed as octal in non-strict mode (511 in decimal)
```
## Binary numbers
Binary number syntax uses a leading zero followed by a lowercase or uppercase Latin letter "B" (0b or 0B). If the digits after the 0b are not 0 or 1, the following SyntaxError is thrown: "Missing binary digits after 0b".
```javascript
var FLT_SIGNBIT  = 0b10000000000000000000000000000000; // 2147483648
var FLT_EXPONENT = 0b01111111100000000000000000000000; // 2139095040
var FLT_MANTISSA = 0B00000000011111111111111111111111; // 8388607
```

## Octal numbers
Octal number syntax uses a leading zero. If the digits after the 0 are outside the range 0 through 7, the number will be interpreted as a decimal number.
```
var n = 0755; // 493
var m = 0644; // 420
```
Strict mode in ECMAScript 5 forbids octal syntax. Octal syntax isn't part of ECMAScript 5, but it's supported in all browsers by prefixing the octal number with a zero: 0644 === 420 and"\045" === "%". In ECMAScript 2015, octal numbers are supported if they are prefixed with 0o, e.g.: 
```javascript
var a = 0o10; // ES2015: 8
```
## Hexadecimal numbers
Hexadecimal number syntax uses a leading zero followed by a lowercase or uppercase Latin letter "X" (0x or 0X). If the digits after 0x are outside the range (0123456789ABCDEF),  the following SyntaxError is thrown: "Identifier starts immediately after numeric literal".

## `Number` object

The built-in Number object has properties for numerical constants, such as maximum value, not-a-number, and infinity. You cannot change the values of these properties and you use them as follows:

```javascript
var biggestNum = Number.MAX_VALUE;
var smallestNum = Number.MIN_VALUE;
var infiniteNum = Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY;
var negInfiniteNum = Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY;
var notANum = Number.NaN;
```
### Methods of Number
Method | 	Description
--- | ---
`Number.parseFloat()` | 	Parses a string argument and returns a floating point number. Same as the global parseFloat() function.
`Number.parseInt()` | 	Parses a string argument and returns an integer of the specified radix or base. Same as the global parseInt() function.
`Number.isFinite()` | 	Determines whether the passed value is a finite number.
`Number.isInteger()` | 	Determines whether the passed value is an integer.
`Number.isNaN()` | 	Determines whether the passed value is NaN. More robust version of the original global isNaN().
`Number.isSafeInteger()` | 	Determines whether the provided value is a number that is a safe integer.

## Math object

The built-in Math object has properties and methods for mathematical constants and functions. For example, the Math object's PI property has the value of pi (3.141...), which you would use in an application as

important functions of `Math`

### abs
```javascript
Math.abs('-1');     // 1
Math.abs(-2);       // 2
Math.abs(null);     // 0
Math.abs('');       // 0
Math.abs([]);       // 0
Math.abs([2]);      // 2
Math.abs([1,2]);    // NaN
Math.abs({});       // NaN
Math.abs('string'); // NaN
Math.abs();         // NaN
```
### pow
```javascript
// simple
Math.pow(7, 2);    // 49
Math.pow(7, 3);    // 343
Math.pow(2, 10);   // 1024
// fractional exponents
Math.pow(4, 0.5);  // 2 (square root of 4)
Math.pow(8, 1/3);  // 2 (cube root of 8)
Math.pow(2, 0.5);  // 1.4142135623730951 (square root of 2)
Math.pow(2, 1/3);  // 1.2599210498948732 (cube root of 2)
// signed exponents
Math.pow(7, -2);   // 0.02040816326530612 (1/49)
Math.pow(8, -1/3); // 0.5
// signed bases
Math.pow(-7, 2);   // 49 (squares are positive)
Math.pow(-7, 3);   // -343 (cubes can be negative)
Math.pow(-7, 0.5); // NaN (negative numbers don't have a real square root)
// due to "even" and "odd" roots laying close to each other, 
// and limits in the floating number precision, 
// negative bases with fractional exponents always return NaN
Math.pow(-7, 1/3); // NaN
```

### log10

```javascript
Math.log10(2);      // 0.3010299956639812
Math.log10(1);      // 0
Math.log10(0);      // -Infinity
Math.log10(-2);     // NaN
Math.log10(100000); // 5
```

### floor

```javascript
Math.floor( 45.95); //  45
Math.floor( 45.05); //  45
Math.floor(  4   ); //   4
Math.floor(-45.05); // -46 
Math.floor(-45.95); // -46
```

### ceil

```javascript
Math.ceil(.95);    // 1
Math.ceil(4);      // 4
Math.ceil(7.004);  // 8
Math.ceil(-0.95);  // -0
Math.ceil(-4);     // -4
Math.ceil(-7.004); // -7
```

### min
value1, value2, ...
Zero or more numbers among which the lowest value will be selected and returned.

The smallest of the given numbers. If any one or more of the parameters cannot be converted into a number, NaN is returned. The result is Infinity if no parameters are provided.

### max

Parameters value1, value2, ... Numbers.

The largest of the given numbers.

If no arguments are given, the result is -Infinity.

If at least one of arguments cannot be converted to a number, the result is NaN.

The new spread operator is a shorter way of writing the apply solution to get the maximum of an array:
```javascript
var arr = [1, 2, 3];
var max = Math.max(...arr);
```
However, both spread (...) and apply will either fail or return the wrong result if the array has too many elements, because they try to pass the array elements as function parameters.

### random

function returns a floating-point, pseudo-random number in the range 0–1 (inclusive of 0, but not 1) with approximately uniform distribution over that range — which you can then scale to your desired range. 

### round

The `Math.round()` function returns the value of a number rounded to the nearest integer.

If the fractional portion of the argument is greater than 0.5, the argument is rounded to the integer with the next higher absolute value. If it is less than 0.5, the argument is rounded to the integer with the lower absolute value.  If the fractional portion is exactly 0.5, the argument is rounded to the next integer in the direction of +∞.

### sqrt

## `Date` object
JavaScript does not have a date data type. However, you can use the Date object and its methods to work with dates and times in your applications. It does not have any properties only methods are there.

JavaScript handles dates similarly to Java. The two languages have many of the same date methods, and both languages store dates as the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00, with a Unix Timestamp being the number of seconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00.

The Date object range is -100,000,000 days to 100,000,000 days relative to 01 January, 1970 UTC.

To create a Date object:
```
var dateObjectName = new Date([parameters]);
```

The parameters in the preceding syntax can be any of the following:

- Nothing: creates today's date and time. For example, `today = new Date();`.
- A string representing a date in the following form: "Month day, year hours:minutes:seconds." For example, `var Xmas95 = new Date("December 25, 1995 13:30:00")`. If you omit hours, minutes, or seconds, the value will be set to zero.
- A set of integer values for year, month, and day. For example, `var Xmas95 = new Date(1995, 11, 25)`.
- A set of integer values for year, month, day, hour, minute, and seconds. For example, `var Xmas95 = new Date(1995, 11, 25, 9, 30, 0);`.

### Methods of the Date object

With the "get" and "set" methods you can get and set seconds, minutes, hours, day of the month, day of the week, months, and years separately. There is a getDay method that returns the day of the week, but no corresponding setDay method, because the day of the week is set automatically. These methods use integers to represent these values as follows:

- Seconds and minutes: 0 to 59
- Hours: 0 to 23
- Day: 0 (Sunday) to 6 (Saturday)
- Date: 1 to 31 (day of the month)
- Months: 0 (January) to 11 (December)
- Year: years since 1900

```javascript
var today = new Date();
var endYear = new Date(1995, 11, 31, 23, 59, 59, 999); // Set day and month
endYear.setFullYear(today.getFullYear()); // Set year to this year
var msPerDay = 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000; // Number of milliseconds per day
var daysLeft = (endYear.getTime() - today.getTime()) / msPerDay;
var daysLeft = Math.round(daysLeft); //returns days left in the year
```
