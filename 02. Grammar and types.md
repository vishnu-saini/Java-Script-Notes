 ## Basics
 
 ### Javascript use Unicode
 
 JavaScript is case-sensitive and uses the Unicode character set. For example, the word Früh (which means "early" in German) could be used as a variable name.
```javascript 
var Früh = "foobar";
```

### Declarations
There are three kinds of declarations in JavaScript.
- **var** : Declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
- **let** : Declares a block-scoped, local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
- **const** : Declares a block-scoped, read-only named constant.

### Variables
A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).

### Evaluating variables

A variable declared using the var or let statement with no assigned value specified has the value of undefined.

An attempt to access an undeclared variable results in a ReferenceError exception being thrown:
```javascript 
var a;
console.log('The value of a is ' + a); // The value of a is undefined

console.log('The value of b is ' + b); // The value of b is undefined
var b;

console.log('The value of c is ' + c); // Uncaught ReferenceError: c is not defined

let x;
console.log('The value of x is ' + x); // The value of x is undefined

console.log('The value of y is ' + y); // Uncaught ReferenceError: y is not defined
let y;
```
You can use undefined to determine whether a variable has a value. In the following code, the variable input is not assigned a value, and the if statement evaluates to true.
```javascript 
var input;
if (input === undefined) {
  doThis();
} else {
  doThat();
}
```
The undefined value behaves as false when used in a boolean context. For example, the following code executes the function myFunction because the myArray element is undefined:
```javascript 
var myArray = [];
if (!myArray[0]) myFunction();
```
The undefined value converts to NaN when used in numeric context.
```javascript 
var a;
a + 2;  // Evaluates to NaN
```
When you evaluate a null variable, the null value behaves as 0 in numeric contexts and as false in boolean contexts. For example:
```javascript 
var n = null;
console.log(n * 32); // Will log 0 to the console
```
### Variable scope
When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.

JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within

```javascript
if (true) {
  var x = 5;
}
console.log(x);  // x is 5
```
This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.
```javascript
if (true) {
  let y = 5;
}
console.log(y);  // ReferenceError: y is not defined
```

### Variable hoisting

Another unusual thing about variables in JavaScript is that you can refer to a variable declared later, without getting an exception. This concept is known as hoisting; variables in JavaScript are in a sense "hoisted" or lifted to the top of the function or statement. However, variables that are hoisted return a value of undefined. So even if you declare and initialize after you use or refer to this variable, it still returns undefined.
```javascript
//Example 1
console.log(x === undefined); // true
var x = 3;

//Example 2
// will return a value of undefined
var myvar = 'my value';
 
(function() {
  console.log(myvar); // undefined
  var myvar = 'local value';
})();
```
The above examples will be interpreted the same as:
```javascript
/**
 * Example 1
 */
var x;
console.log(x === undefined); // true
x = 3;
 
/**
 * Example 2
 */
var myvar = 'my value';
 
(function() {
  var myvar;
  console.log(myvar); // undefined
  myvar = 'local value';
})();
```
In ECMAScript 2015, let (const) does not hoist the variable to the top of the block. Referencing the variable in the block before the variable declaration results in a ReferenceError. The variable is in a "temporal dead zone" from the start of the block until the declaration is processed.
```javascript
console.log(x); // ReferenceError
let x = 3;
```

### Function hoisting
For functions, only the function declaration gets hoisted to the top and not the function expression.
```javascript
/* Function declaration */
foo(); // "bar"
function foo() {
  console.log('bar');
}

/* Function expression */
baz(); // TypeError: baz is not a function
var baz = function() {
  console.log('bar2');
};
```

### Global variables
Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages, the global object is window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax

### Constants

You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign ($) and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
```javascript
const PI = 3.14;
```
A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It must be initialized to a value.
The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block-scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.
You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example:
```javascript
// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR
function f() {};
const f = 5;

// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR TOO
function f() {
  const g = 5;
  var g;

  //statements
}
```
However, the properties of objects assigned to constants are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.
```javascript
const MY_OBJECT = {'key': 'value'};
MY_OBJECT.key = 'otherValue';
```
Also, the contents of an array are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.
```javascript
const MY_ARRAY = ['HTML','CSS'];
MY_ARRAY.push('JAVASCRIPT');
console.log(MY_ARRAY); //logs ['HTML','CSS','JAVASCRIPT'];
```

## Data structures and types

### Data types

The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:

- Six data types that are primitives:
  - **`Boolean`**. true and false.
  - **`null`**. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.
  - **`undefined`**. A top-level property whose value is not defined.
  - **`Number`**. An integer or floating point number. For example: 42 or 3.14159.
  - **`String`**. A sequence of characters that represent a text value. For example:  "Howdy"
  - **`Symbol`** (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.
- and **`Object`**

Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your application can perform.

### Converting strings to numbers

In the case that a value representing a number is in memory as a string, there are methods for conversion.

- parseInt()
- parseFloat()

parseInt only returns whole numbers, so its use is diminished for decimals. Additionally, a best practice for parseInt is to always include the radix parameter. The radix parameter is used to specify which numerical system is to be used.

An alternative method of retrieving a number from a string is with the + (unary plus) operator:
```javascript
'1.1' + '1.1' // '1.11.1'
(+'1.1') + (+'1.1') // 2.2   
// Note: the parentheses are added for clarity, not required.
```
## Literals

You use literals to represent values in JavaScript. These are fixed values, not variables, that you literally provide in your script. This section describes the following types of literals:

- Array literals
- Boolean literals
- Floating-point literals
- Integers
- Object literals
- RegExp literals
- String literals

### Array literals
An array literal is a list of zero or more expressions, each of which represents an array element, enclosed in square brackets ([]).
#### Extra commas in array literals
You do not have to specify all elements in an array literal. If you put two commas in a row, the array is created with undefined for the unspecified elements. The following example creates the fish array:
```javascript
var fish = ['Lion', , 'Angel'];
```
This array has two elements with values and one empty element (fish[0] is "Lion", fish[1] is undefined, and fish[2] is "Angel").

In the following example, the length of the array is four, and myList[1] and myList[3] are missing. Only the last comma is ignored.
```javascript
var myList = ['home', , 'school', , ];
```

### Boolean literals
The Boolean type has two literal values: true and false.

Do not confuse the primitive Boolean values true and false with the true and false values of the Boolean object. The Boolean object is a wrapper around the primitive Boolean data type. 

### Numeric literals
Some examples of integer literals are:
```
0, 117 and -345 (decimal, base 10)
015, 0001 and -0o77 (octal, base 8) 
0x1123, 0x00111 and -0xF1A7 (hexadecimal, "hex" or base 16)
0b11, 0b0011 and -0b11 (binary, base 2)
```

### Floating-point literals
A floating-point literal can have the following parts:

- A decimal integer which can be signed (preceded by "+" or "-"),
- A decimal point ("."),
- A fraction (another decimal number),
- An exponent.
The exponent part is an "e" or "E" followed by an integer, which can be signed (preceded by "+" or "-"). A floating-point literal must have at least one digit and either a decimal point or "e" (or "E").

More succinctly, the syntax is:
```
[(+|-)][digits][.digits][(E|e)[(+|-)]digits]
```
For example:
```
3.1415926
-.123456789
-3.1E+12
.1e-23
 ```
### Object literals

An object literal is a list of zero or more pairs of property names and associated values of an object, enclosed in curly braces ({}). Do not use an object literal at the beginning of a statement. This will lead to an error or not behave as you expect, because the { will be interpreted as the beginning of a block.

### Enhanced Object literals

In ES2015, object literals are extended to support setting the prototype at construction, shorthand for foo: foo assignments, defining methods, making super calls, and computing property names with expressions. Together, these also bring object literals and class declarations closer together, and let object-based design benefit from some of the same conveniences.
```javascript
var obj = {
    // __proto__
    __proto__: theProtoObj,
    // Shorthand for ‘handler: handler’
    handler,
    // Methods
    toString() {
     // Super calls
     return 'd ' + super.toString();
    },
    // Computed (dynamic) property names
    [ 'prop_' + (() => 42)() ]: 42
};
```
Please note:
```javascript
var foo = {a: 'alpha', 2: 'two'};
console.log(foo.a);    // alpha
console.log(foo[2]);   // two
//console.log(foo.2);  // Error: Unexpected number
//console.log(foo[a]); // Error: a is not defined
console.log(foo['a']); // alpha
console.log(foo['2']); // two
```
### RegExp literals
A regex literal (which is defined in detail later) is a pattern enclosed between slashes. The following is an example of a regex literal.
```javascript
var re = /ab+c/;
```

### String literals
A string literal is zero or more characters enclosed in double (") or single (') quotation marks.

You can call any of the methods of the String object on a string literal value—JavaScript automatically converts the string literal to a temporary String object, calls the method, then discards the temporary String object. You can also use the `String.length` property with a string literal:

#### template literals

In ES2015, **template literals** are also available. Template literals are enclosed by the back-tick (` `)  (grave accent) character instead of double or single quotes. Template strings provide syntactic sugar for constructing strings.

```javascript
// Basic literal string creation
`In JavaScript '\n' is a line-feed.`

// Multiline strings
`In JavaScript template strings can run
 over multiple lines, but double and single
 quoted strings cannot.`

// String interpolation
var name = 'Bob', time = 'today';
`Hello ${name}, how are you ${time}?`
```

#### Using special characters in strings
In addition to ordinary characters, you can also include special characters in strings, as shown in the following example.
eg. 
'one line \n another line'

### Escaping characters
For characters not listed in the table, a preceding backslash is ignored, but this usage is deprecated and should be avoided.
You can insert a quotation mark inside a string by preceding it with a backslash. This is known as escaping the quotation mark. For example:
```javascript
var quote = "He read \"The Cremation of Sam McGee\" by R.W. Service.";
console.log(quote);
```

You can also escape line breaks by preceding them with backslash. The backslash and line break are both removed from the value of the string.

```javascript
var str = 'this string \
is broken \
across multiple \
lines.'
console.log(str);   // this string is broken across multiple lines.
```
