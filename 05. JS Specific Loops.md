## for...in statement

The for...in statement iterates a specified variable over all the enumerable properties of an object. For each distinct property, JavaScript executes the specified statements. A for...in statement looks as follows:
```
for (variable in object) {
  statements
}
```
Example 

```javascript
var string1 = "";
var object1 = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3};

for (var property1 in object1) {
  string1 = string1 + object1[property1];
}

console.log(string1);
// expected output: "123"
```

### with Arrays

>Although it may be tempting to use this as a way to iterate over Array elements, the for...in statement will return the name of your user-defined properties in addition to the numeric indexes. Thus it is better to use a traditional for loop with a numeric index when iterating over arrays, because the for...in statement iterates over user-defined properties in addition to the array elements, if you modify the Array object, such as adding custom properties or methods.

## for...of statement

The for...of statement creates a loop Iterating over iterable objects (including Array, Map, Set, arguments object and so on), invoking a custom iteration hook with statements to be executed for the value of each distinct property.

```
for (variable of object) {
  statement
}
```

The following example shows the difference between a for...of loop and a for...in loop. While for...in iterates over property names, for...of iterates over property values:

```javascript
var arr = [3, 5, 7];
arr.foo = 'hello';

for (var i in arr) {
   console.log(i); // logs "0", "1", "2", "foo"
}

for (var i of arr) {
   console.log(i); // logs 3, 5, 7
}
```
