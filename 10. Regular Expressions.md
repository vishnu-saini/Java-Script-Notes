# Regular expressions

Regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. In JavaScript, regular expressions are also objects. These patterns are used with the exec and test methods of RegExp, and with the match, replace, search, and split methods of String. 

## Creating a regular expression
You construct a regular expression in one of two ways:

Using a regular expression literal, which consists of a pattern enclosed between slashes, as follows:
```javascript
var re = /ab+c/;
```

Regular expression literals provide compilation of the regular expression when the script is loaded. If the regular expression remains constant, using this can improve performance.

Or calling the constructor function of the RegExp object, as follows:
```javascript
var re = new RegExp('ab+c');
```

Using the constructor function provides runtime compilation of the regular expression. Use the constructor function when you know the regular expression pattern will be changing, or you don't know the pattern and are getting it from another source, such as user input.

## Writing a regular expression pattern

### Using simple patterns
Simple patterns are constructed of characters for which you want to find a direct match. For example, the pattern /abc/ matches character combinations in strings only when exactly the characters 'abc' occur together and in that order.

### Using special characters

- `\\` A backslash that precedes a non-special character indicates that the next character is special and is not to be interpreted literally.
- `^` Matches beginning of input.
- `$` Matches end of input.
- `\*` Matches the preceding expression 0 or more times. Equivalent to {0,}.
- `+` Matches the preceding expression 1 or more times. Equivalent to {1,}
- `?` Matches the preceding expression 0 or 1 time. Equivalent to {0,1}.
- `.` (The decimal point) matches any single character except the newline character.
- `x\|y` Matches 'x', or 'y' (if there is no match for 'x').
