# Regular expressions

Regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. In JavaScript, regular expressions are also objects. These patterns are used with the exec and test methods of RegExp, and with the match, replace, search, and split methods of String. 

## Creating a regular expression
You construct a regular expression in one of two ways:

Using a regular expression literal, which consists of a pattern enclosed between slashes, as follows:
```javascript
var re = /ab+c/;
```

Regular expression literals provide compilation of the regular expression when the script is loaded. If the regular expression remains constant, using this can improve performance.

Or calling the constructor function of the RegExp object, as follows:
```javascript
var re = new RegExp('ab+c');
```

Using the constructor function provides runtime compilation of the regular expression. Use the constructor function when you know the regular expression pattern will be changing, or you don't know the pattern and are getting it from another source, such as user input.

## Writing a regular expression pattern

### Using simple patterns
Simple patterns are constructed of characters for which you want to find a direct match. For example, the pattern /abc/ matches character combinations in strings only when exactly the characters 'abc' occur together and in that order.

### Using special characters

- `\` A backslash that precedes a non-special character indicates that the next character is special and is not to be interpreted literally.
- `^` Matches beginning of input.
- `$` Matches end of input.
- `*` Matches the preceding expression 0 or more times. Equivalent to {0,}.
- `+` Matches the preceding expression 1 or more times. Equivalent to {1,}
- `?` Matches the preceding expression 0 or 1 time. Equivalent to {0,1}.
- `.` (The decimal point) matches any single character except the newline character.
- `x|y` Matches 'x', or 'y' (if there is no match for 'x').
- '{n}' Matches exactly n occurrences of the preceding expression. N must be a positive integer.
- `{n,}` Matches at least n occurrences of the preceding expression. N must be a positive integer.
- `{n,m}` Where n and m are positive integers and n <= m. Matches at least n and at most m occurrences of the preceding expression. When m is omitted, it's treated as âˆž.
- `[xyz]` Character set. This pattern type matches any one of the characters in the brackets, including escape sequences. Special characters like the dot(.) and asterisk (\*) are not special inside a character set, so they don't need to be escaped.
- `[^xyz]` A negated or complemented character set. That is, it matches anything that is not enclosed in the brackets. You can specify a range of characters by using a hyphen.
- `\d` Matches a digit character. Equivalent to [0-9].  
- `\D` 	Matches a non-digit character. Equivalent to [^0-9].
- `\w` Matches any alphanumeric character including the underscore. Equivalent to [A-Za-z0-9_].
- `\W` Matches any non-word character. Equivalent to [^A-Za-z0-9_].

### Using parentheses
Parentheses around any part of the regular expression pattern causes that part of the matched substring to be remembered. Once remembered, the substring can be recalled for other use, as described in Using Parenthesized Substring Matches.

For example, the pattern /Chapter (\d+)\.\d*/ illustrates additional escaped and special characters and indicates that part of the pattern should be remembered. It matches precisely the characters 'Chapter ' followed by one or more numeric characters (\d means any numeric character and + means 1 or more times), followed by a decimal point (which in itself is a special character; preceding the decimal point with \ means the pattern must look for the literal character '.'), followed by any numeric character 0 or more times (\d means numeric character, * means 0 or more times). In addition, parentheses are used to remember the first matched numeric characters.


## Working with regular expressions
Regular expressions are used with the `RegExp` methods `test` and `exec` and with the String methods `match`, `replace`, `search`, and `split`.

```javascript
var myArray = /d(b+)d/g.exec('cdbbdbsbz'); // similar to "cdbbdbsbz".match(/d(b+)d/g); however,
    // the latter outputs Array [ "dbbd" ], while 
    // /d(b+)d/g.exec('cdbbdbsbz') outputs Array [ 'dbbd', 'bb', index: 1, input: 'cdbbdbsbz' ].
```
